Code to accompanied the paper Quynh M Nguyen et al, "Early turbulence and pulsatile flows enhancediodicity of Tesla's macrofluidic valve," _Nature Communications_.
Quasi-linear model for a bridge formation circuit, with each of the resistor has resistance depends on sign and amplitude of current.
For the same current, the resistance is always large in forward direction than in reverse. These resistors act as leaky diode.
