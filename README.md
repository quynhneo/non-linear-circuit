# non-linear-circuit
Code to accompanied the paper Quynh M Nguyen et al, Nature Communications.
Quasi-linear model for a bridge formation circuit, with each of the resistor has resistance depends on sign and amplitude of current.
For the same current, the resistance is always large in forward direction than in reverse. These resistors act as leaky diode.
